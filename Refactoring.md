# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

First, descriptive variable names were introduced, providing clarity about the purpose of each variable. This improves the understanding of the code's logic.

The conditional statements were simplified and consolidated to reduce complexity. By combining similar conditions and checking for falsy/truthy values, the code becomes easier to follow.

Furthermore, the corrected unit tests ensure that all scenarios are covered, including edge cases such as long partition keys and null event inputs.

Overall, these changes make the code more readable by using meaningful variable names, simplifying conditionals, and providing comprehensive test coverage. This improves the code's maintainability and readability.
